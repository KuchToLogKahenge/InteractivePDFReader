# Creating an interactive PDF reader using LangChain and Streamlit. 
### 1. When a file is uploaded, the PDF reader will extract chunks of text from it and generate embeddings for each chunk. It will then create a searchable database.
### 2. Users can interact with the PDF reader with a chatbot.
### 3. When a question is presented to the chatbot, the reader generates an embedding for the question and searches the database for answers.
### 4. The most relevant chunk and the chat history are then used as context to generate an answer in natural language using a large language model (LLM).
### 5. This response is shown to the user and appended to the chat history.
